# 💼 About The Project

The online chess application is a platform for playing chess against a computer or other players. The application offers various features, including:

## 👨‍💻 Play Against the Computer:

- ability to set piece colors
- adjustable difficulty level using the Stockfish engine
- blindfold chess mode with moves selectable via the interface
- hide/show the chessboard for blindfold chess mode
- undo move
- new game

## 👨‍🍳 Multiplayer mode (work in progress 💪):

- development ongoing for multiplayer functionality based on websockets
- TODO features include:

  - storing games and moves history
  - chat feature for players to communicate during the game
  - player profiles with statistics and a history of past games
  - inviting a friend to play via a unique generated link
